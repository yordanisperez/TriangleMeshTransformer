# TriangleMeshTransformer
### A WPF Application for Manipulating and Visualizing Triangle Meshes with Geometry3Sharp and OpenGL

"TriangleMeshTransformer is a WPF application designed to manipulate and 
visualize 3D triangle meshes using the geometry libraries of Geometry3Sharp and OpenGL. 
With TriangleMeshTransformer, users can load triangle meshes in various formats, 
apply geometric transformations, and visualize the result in real-time. Additionally, 
TriangleMeshTransformer allows users to save the transformed meshes in different file
formats and share them with other users. TriangleMeshTransformer is a useful tool for 
anyone interested in manipulating and visualizing 3D triangle meshes, including engineers, artists, 
and data scientists."
